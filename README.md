# Course-Project-Data-files
This project is done by Tarka Venkatesh Boppudi, Dharmendhar Reddy Kolanu, Manoj Kumar Boppudi. 
These are the data files that i used and created for my study. 
I used the filtered_data_sorted file as a source file to select projects for my data. I created this file from the given currated_pthon_list.csv file by applying filters like python ration>0.8.
All the remaining tier1, tier2 and tier3 files are created by us by using cohesion and pyreverse tools to collect data. This collected cohesion and dependency data is accumulated in these files.
